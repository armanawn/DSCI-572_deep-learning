## Lab assignments

There will be one lab assignment per week. We will follow the standard MDS lab deadlines.

## Quizzes

Quizzes will be **open book**, meaning you may consult course materials, online sources, etc. However, communication with other people during the quiz is strictly forbidden. See the MDS quiz instructions [here](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/quiz/). For the dates/times of the quizzes, see the [MDS calendar](https://ubc-mds.github.io/calendar/).

## Installation

The Conda environment file for the course is [here](dsci572env.yml). To create the environment, run `conda env create -f dsci572env.yml`. Make sure to use the `dsci572` kernel for your Jupyter notebooks.
